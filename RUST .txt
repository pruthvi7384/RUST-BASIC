* Scope * : 
- Range within a program for which an item is valid 
- Global Scope : Accessible throughout the entire program.
- Local Scope :
	- Accessible only within particular function or block of code.
	- Not accessible outside of that function or block.

* Memory *
- Component in a computer to store data and instruction for the processor to execute.
- Random Access Memorry (RAM) is volatile, when power turned off all content are lost.
- Two types of regions in RAM used by a program at runtime: Stack memory and heap memory.

* The String Type *
- All types covered so far were fixed size
- String is mutable
- String size can change at runtime
- String stored on the stack with a pointer to the heap
- alue of string is stored on the heap


* Referance : & and get value *

* String VS. &str *
- A String is a heap-allocated string type that owns its contents and is mutable.
- A &str is an immutable sequence of UTF-8 bytes in memory, it does not own the underlying data and is immutable.
- Think of &str as a view on a sequence of characters (stored as UTF-8 bytes) in memory.

* String Liteal *
- A String literalis a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (")
- Fixted size, compile-time known sequence of UTF-8 bytes
- The type is '&' static str, which indicates the data is stored in static storage, meaning it is valid throughout the entire lifetime of the program
- The data is hardcoded into the executable and stored in read-only memory, meaning they are immutable.

* Slice *
- The string slice world points to a sequence of characters stored on the heap.
